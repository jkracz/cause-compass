# Database Migration Summary: User Preferences & Liked Organizations

## Overview
Successfully migrated user preferences and liked organizations from localStorage to MongoDB database storage. This implementation provides persistent data storage, better data integrity, and prepares the application for multi-device user experiences.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema & Models

#### Created User Model (`src/server/db/models/User.ts`)
- **Schema**: User document with userId, preferences, likedOrganizations, timestamps
- **Indexes**: Added indexes on userId, preferences.causes, and preferences.changeScope for query optimization
- **Interface**: IUser extends Mongoose Document with proper TypeScript typing

#### User Preferences Structure
```typescript
preferences: {
  openEnded?: string;      // Open-ended reflection answer
  causes?: string[];       // Selected cause categories
  helpMethod?: string[];   // How user prefers to help
  changeScope?: string;    // Local/national/global preference
  location?: string;       // Location data or permission status
}
```

### 2. Database Queries (`src/server/db/queries/user.ts`)

#### Implemented Functions
- `saveUserPreferences()` - Create/update user preferences (upsert)
- `getUserPreferences()` - Retrieve user preferences
- `addLikedOrganization()` - Add organization to user's liked list
- `removeLikedOrganization()` - Remove organization from liked list
- `getLikedOrganizations()` - Get user's liked organization IDs
- `updateUserPreferences()` - Partial preference updates
- `clearUserData()` - Delete all user data

#### Database Operations
- Uses MongoDB upsert operations for seamless user creation/updates
- Implements `$addToSet` for preventing duplicate liked organizations
- Includes proper error handling and connection management

### 3. Server Actions (`src/lib/actions/user.ts`)

#### Updated Functions
- `saveUserPreferences()` - Now saves to database instead of localStorage
- `getUserPreferencesAction()` - Retrieves preferences from database
- `addLikedOrganization()` - Database persistence for liked orgs
- `removeLikedOrganization()` - Database removal of liked orgs
- `getLikedOrganizationsAction()` - Database retrieval of liked orgs
- `updateUserPreferences()` - Partial preference updates
- `clearUserSession()` - Clears database and cookies

#### Features
- Maintains cookie-based user session management
- Proper error handling with fallback behaviors
- Server-side redirects after successful operations

### 4. Client-Side Updates

#### Onboarding Page (`src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Saved answers to localStorage
- **After**: Converts answers to FormData and calls server action
- Maintains same UX with proper error handling

#### Discover Page (`src/app/discover/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Loaded preferences and liked orgs from localStorage
- **After**: Loads data via server actions on component mount
- Updates liked organizations through database instead of localStorage
- Includes fallback local state updates for better UX

#### My Organizations Page (`src/app/my-orgs/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Managed all data through localStorage
- **After**: Loads and manages data through server actions
- Async operations for removing organizations and clearing data
- Proper error handling with fallback behaviors

### 5. Type Safety (`src/lib/types.ts`)

#### Added Types
```typescript
export interface UserPreferences {
  openEnded?: string;
  causes?: string[];
  helpMethod?: string[];
  changeScope?: string;
  location?: string;
}

export interface User {
  userId: string;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  likedOrganizations: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Technical Benefits

### Data Persistence
- User data survives browser cache clears and device switches
- Consistent data storage across sessions
- Proper data backup and recovery capabilities

### Performance Improvements
- Database indexing for faster queries
- Upsert operations reduce database calls
- Efficient array operations with MongoDB operators

### Scalability
- Ready for multi-user concurrent access
- Database connection pooling and caching
- Prepared for user authentication integration

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when database operations fail
- Client-side error boundaries maintain UX
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Organization Integration**: Replace mock data filtering with proper organization queries
2. **User Authentication**: Integrate with authentication system for secure user identification
3. **Data Analytics**: Add tracking for user preferences and behavior analysis
4. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis or similar for frequently accessed data
5. **Data Migration**: Create scripts for migrating existing localStorage data if needed

### Potential Improvements
- Add preference versioning for schema evolution
- Implement preference recommendation engine
- Add preference sharing between users
- Create preference export/import functionality

## Database Schema Details

### Collections
- `users`: Stores user preferences and liked organizations
- `tax_exempt_organizations`: Existing organization data (unchanged)

### Indexes Created
```javascript
// User collection indexes
{ userId: 1 }                        // Primary lookup
{ 'preferences.causes': 1 }          // Cause-based queries
{ 'preferences.changeScope': 1 }     // Scope-based filtering
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Database Testing
- Test upsert operations with new and existing users
- Verify array operations for liked organizations
- Test concurrent user operations
- Validate index performance

### Integration Testing
- Test full user journey from onboarding to organization management
- Verify error handling when database is unavailable
- Test data consistency across different pages

### Performance Testing
- Measure query response times with varying data sizes
- Test concurrent user operations
- Validate memory usage with large datasets

This migration provides a solid foundation for user data management while maintaining the existing user experience and preparing for future enhancements.
